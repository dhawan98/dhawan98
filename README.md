### 👨‍💻 About Me

Computer Science graduate passionate about building adaptive, intelligent systems. I've contributed to research at **ISRO**, **UBTECH AI Lab (University of Sydney)**, and **The University of Florida**, focusing on machine learning infrastructure and real-world AI applications.


Lately, I’ve been diving into:
- Autonomous job application agents using LLMs  
- LoRA-based personalization of image generation pipelines  
- Multilingual and low-resource translation systems  
- AI agents that jam music (yes, they play drums while I play guitar 🎸)  
- Reducing annotation effort via few-shot learning in concept learning systems

### 🚀 Featured Projects

- 🤖 **Autonomous Job Application Agent**  
  Gemini-powered FastAPI system that finds, scores, and applies to jobs on its own. Supports form autofill, fallback handling, and multi-step application logic.

- 🎨 **Image Generation with LoRA Adapters**  
  Built a modular FastAPI pipeline for training and switching LoRA adapters to generate Pokémon and custom concepts. Includes Google Drive cloud integration.

- 🌍 **Multilingual MT with mBART50 + CLIP**  
  Finetuned mBART50 for Spanish–Guarani and Spanish–Quechua translation using CLIP and multi-GPU training on HiPerGator.

- 🧠 **TensorFlow Documentation Bot**  
  AI-powered chatbot using FastAPI + OpenAI to answer TensorFlow docs questions in real-time. Helps developers find answers without skimming docs.

### 🎯 Fun Fact
I built an AI agent to jam music with me. I play guitar, it plays drums. Together, we make some interesting noise.
